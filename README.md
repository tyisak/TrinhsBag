DO NOT LOOK AT THE CODE BEFORE COMPLETING THE CHALLENGE.

To succesfully complete the challenge, take the .py file above, and put it in your favorite python interpreter. You can find one online, or just upload it to your replit and run it there. BUT PLEASE DO NOT LOOK AT THE CODE! IT IS IMPORTANT!

Let me know if you need any help. I hope you enjoy :)
